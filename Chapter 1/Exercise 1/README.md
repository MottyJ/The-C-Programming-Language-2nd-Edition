# Exercise 1-1. 
Run the "hello, world" program on your system. Experiment with leaving out parts of the program, to see what error messages you get.

# Notes
Although the program compiles and runs, it compiles with a warning:
  ```hello_world.c:3:1: warning: type specifier missing, defaults to 'int' [-Wimplicit-int]
  main()
  ^```
Obiously, in later versions of C, the functions began requiring type specificity.
